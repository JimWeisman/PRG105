print("Over the river and through the woods,")
print("To grandmother's house we go;")
print("The horse knows the way to carry the sleigh,")
print("Through (the) white and drifted snow!\n")

print("Over the river and through the woods,")
print("Oh, how the wind does blow!")
print("It stings the toes and bites the nose,")
print("As over the ground we go.\n")

print("Over the river and through the woods,")
print("To have a first-rate play;")
print("Oh, hear the bells ring, \"Ting-a-ling-ling\"!")
print("Hurrah for Thanksgiving Day! \n")

print("Over the river and through the woods,")
print("Trot fast, my dapple gray!")
print("Spring over the ground,")
print("Like a hunting hound!")
print("For this is Thanksgiving Day. \n")

print("Over the river and through the woods,")
print("And straight through the barnyard gate.")
print("We seem to go extremely slow ")
print("It is so hard to wait! \n")

print("Over the river and through the woods,")
print("Now Grandmother's cap I spy!")
print("Hurrah for the fun! Is the pudding done?")
print(" Hurrah for the pumpkin pie!\n")
